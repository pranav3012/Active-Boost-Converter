# Active-Boost-Converter
DC to DC Active Boost Converter 12V to 35V.

Purpose of the project

Boost Converter is a DC to DC boost converter that steps up the voltage from its input to output and will generate the output voltage that is greater or equal to the input voltage. 
But the only drawback of the boost converter is that if the output load varies, the output voltage also varies, so we use the Active boost converter.

Introduction

The active boost converter is a device that will maintain the same output even if the output load is varying.
• The active Boost converter is a close loop system that will continuously monitor the output voltage, and if there is any variation, the output will be corrected.

Implementation

•	The MOSFET acts as a switch that is controlled by the PWM, which is generated by the Nucleo-f411re development board.
•	When the MOSFET is closed, the inductor charges, and it stores the energy. 
•	And when the switch is open, the inductor acts as a voltage source, and the stored voltage appears across the output.
•	The output voltage can be varied by controlling the PWM duty cycle.
•	So if we implement close loop control, we can maintain a constant voltage at the output even if the voltage is varying.
•	We can also vary the output digitally by generating the reference voltage accordingly.
•	So we are going to communicate with the Nucleo-L432KC dev board Via VCP and according generate a DAC output.
•	The system will have a PI control which will get the op of the boost converter and according to the reference voltage set the output will be generated.
•	In this way the output will be precisely controlled.
